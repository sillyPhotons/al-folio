[Engineering physics](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) undergraduate at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 

My current research is focused on studying the strongly correlated electronic states of moiré graphene superlattices through transport and thermodynamic measurements. I appreciate a good cup of `coffee` ☕.  Please feel free to contact me through <a href="mailto:raysu@student.ubc.ca">email</a> if you have any questions. I am actively seeking opportunities for graduate study in Physics for 2024. 

<!-- I fabricate my devices using the state-of-the-art electron beam lithography system (`JEOL JBX-8100FS`), and measure their transport properties in a `BlueFors XLD` dilution refrigerator.   -->
