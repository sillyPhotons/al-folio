I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year [engineering physics](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) student at the University of British Columbia. I am interested in experimental `condensed matter` physics. 

At the <a href="https://phas.ubc.ca/~qdev/">Quantum Devices Group</a>, I fabricate GaAs/AlGaAs quantum devices using a state-of-the-art electron beam lithography system (`JEOL JBX-8100FS`), and measure their transport properties the `BlueFors XLD` dilution refrigerator.  

I appreciate a good cup of `coffee` â˜• and _you_ --- for checking out my website.  Please feel free to contact me through <a href="mailto:raysu@student.ubc.ca">email</a> if you have any questions.
