I am an undergraduate pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. My research explores electronic phases in multilayer graphene, often in combination with a moiré potential or spin-orbit coupled materials such as tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>). 

I am actively seeking graduate student positions for 2024! ☕
