I am an undergraduate pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. My research is focused on probing electronic phases in multilayer graphene (super)lattices, sometimes interfaced with a strong spin-orbit coupled material, such as tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>).

I am actively seeking graduate opportunities in Physics for 2024! â˜•
