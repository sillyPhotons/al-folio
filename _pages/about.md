I am an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 

My research is focused on probing emergent electronic phases in (twisted) graphene multilayers using low-temperature transport experiments. 

I am actively seeking graduate opportunities in Physics for 2024!
