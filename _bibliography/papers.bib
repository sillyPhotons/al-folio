    Superconductivity has been previously observed in magic-angle twisted stacks of monolayer graphene but conspicuously not in twisted stacks of bilayer graphene, although both systems host topological flat bands and symmetry-broken states. Here, we report the discovery of superconductivity in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) in proximity to WSe2. Samples with twist angles 1.24∘ and 1.37∘ superconduct in small pockets of the gate-tuned phase diagram within the valence and conduction band, respectively. Superconductivity emerges from unpolarized states near van Hove singularities and next to regions with broken isospin symmetry, showing the correlation between a high density of states and the emergence of superconductivity in TDBG while revealing a possible role for isospin fluctuations in the pairing.

The program can predict the effect of well-separated radiation fractions on tumor growth and the Kaplan-Meier survival curve for an arbitrary patient population using a Monte Carlo method. While our program partially reproduces Geng et al.'s results well, further improvements to the source code and conceptual clarification is required.},

  abstract = {Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are ubiquitous in our daily lives. The MEMS accelerometer is used in tablets to detect device orientation, and in cars to detect collisions so airbags can be deployed. In this report, we developed mechanical models for a single- and dual-axis accelerometer attached to a planar rigid body using Lagrangian mechanics. By solving the associated Euler-Lagrange equations, we gained insight into how the damping coefficient and the natural frequency affect the accelerometer's linear operating range, sensitivity, and recovery time.},
