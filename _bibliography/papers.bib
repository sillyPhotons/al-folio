    Identifying the essential components of superconductivity in graphene-based systems remains a critical problem in two-dimensional materials research. This field is connected to the mysteries that underpin investigations of unconventional superconductivity in condensed-matter physics. Superconductivity has been observed in magic-angle twisted stacks of monolayer graphene but conspicuously not in twisted stacks of bilayer graphene, although both systems host topological flat bands and symmetry-broken states. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) in proximity to WSe<sub>2</sub>. Samples with twist angles 1.24° and 1.37° superconduct in small pockets of the gate-tuned phase diagram within the valence and conduction band, respectively. Superconductivity emerges from unpolarized phases near van Hove singularities and next to regions with broken isospin symmetry. Our results show the correlation between a high density of states and the emergence of superconductivity in TDBG while revealing a possible role for isospin fluctuations in the pairing.
