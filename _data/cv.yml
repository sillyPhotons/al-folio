  # - I've independently completed the full cycle of design, fabrication, and measurement of nanoscale GaAs/AlGaAs samples in millikelvin temperatures. 
  - I would like to understand quantum effects that arise in 2D materials and GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure systems, such as the integer and fractional quantum hall effect, and the Kondo effect. 
  - I would also like to explore novel measurements techniques such as quantum capacitance sensing
